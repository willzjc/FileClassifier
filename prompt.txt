I need a better filename, foldername, and category for this file.

Current filename: {name}
File extension: {extension}
MIME type: {mime_type}
File size: {size_bytes} bytes

{preview}

Please provide the following in a json string output:
1. "fileName" : "correctFilename.ext", 
2. "folderName" : "Suggested Folder Name",
3. "category" : "Suggested Category"

1. Filename
Please suggest a clear, descriptive filename that follows these rules:
- Keep the same file extension
- Use Upper case camel case
- if extension is PDF, it maybe a book title so use the official book title, and use spaced out words
- if it's an executable, try to see what software it is, then use that software name
- Be specific and descriptive about the content
- Maximum 50 characters (excluding extension)
- Return ONLY the new filename with no additional text or explanation

2. Foldername
 - Similar to above, except remove any file extensions for this name
 - Do not show any versioning
 - The words have to be separated by space
 - If it's an application, just have the application, don't need to leave things like 'installer' or 'disk image' or "Mac/Windows" or "Application" etc

3. Category
 - Suggest a category for the file based on its content, such as "Software", "Book", "Image", "Video", etc.
 - Provide a single word or short phrase.
